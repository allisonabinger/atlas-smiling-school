## Intro
Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework developed by Twitter (X) directed as responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS and JavaScript design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. 

In this project, I was given three Figma files to recreate using as much Bootstrap as I can. while there is a styles.css file used, we were instructed to keep the file as small as possible. 

This project uses Bootstrap version 4.4.1 and three Figma files to reference:, which can be found in the /FigFiles directory.
